# Alphorge – One Pager  

## 🚩 Problem & Promise  
Building new software ventures is fragmented: founders must separately validate demand, fund prototypes, hire engineers, test markets, launch campaigns, and manage fulfillment.  
This takes months, burns cash, and often fails before product–market fit is proven.  

**Alphorge compresses the entire venture cycle into a single system.**  
From first demand signal to shipped product, agents validate, build, market, and deliver with only one QA/creative check before release.

## 🧩 Agent Roster  

- **Demand Intelligence** – gathers signals (HN, GH, G2, social, trends) and forecasts with uncertainty bands.  
- **Opportunity Ranker** – scores ROI, time-to-MVP, fit-to-market.  
- **Discovery & Outreach** – runs survey/cadence, manages consent, and books calls.  
- **Product Builder** – auto-generates repos (FastAPI, DB, LangGraph flows, React UI, tests, CI) via Cursor patches.  
- **Release Manager** – CI/CD pipeline, changelog, preview URLs, HITL approval gates.  
- **Pricing & Packaging** – creates guardrailed tiers, runs willingness-to-pay (WTP) experiments.  
- **Marketing & Sales** – launches ETA-aware campaigns, assets, and CRM integration.  
- **Fulfillment & Success** – provisions accounts, collects telemetry, NPS surveys, and upsell offers.

## 📊 Data, Evals & KPIs  

- **Demand →** signals ingested, forecasts generated, uncertainty quantified.  
- **Build →** repo scaffolds, diffs, test pass rates, release approvals.  
- **Go-to-Market →** outreach response %, campaign conversion %, pricing elasticity.  
- **Ops →** provisioning latency, onboarding completion, telemetry coverage.  
- **Governance →** policy receipts, hash-chain signatures, trace coverage.  

---

## ⚠️ Risks & Mitigations  

- **Spam / Compliance** → consent-first outreach, throttled cadences.  
- **Hallucinations** → enforced tests + human-in-the-loop approvals before release.  
- **Spend Overruns** → usage caps, WTP tests, pricing guardrails.  
- **Brand Risk** → audit chain + HITL gates for sensitive actions.  

---

## 🗓 30/60/90 Plan  

- **30 Days**: Core orchestration in LangGraph; basic Demand, Builder, and Release agents wired to Studio UI.  
- **60 Days**: Outreach flows with consent; Pricing guardrails; signed hash-chain audits.  
- **90 Days**: Closed loop: demand discovery → validated repo → launched campaign → telemetry feedback → upsell path.

## 🌟 The Pitch  
Alphorge is not just tooling — it’s a **venture factory in a box**.  
One demand signal in → one functioning, governed, launched product out.
